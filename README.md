# N_remover
A python script designed to remove all rows containing the "|N|" string in a .csv file. Specifically designed for use with SNP count matrix files, wherein erroneous SNPs are generated due to a reference-gene mismatch during SNP calling with metaSNV. The script is very simple, and can be edited to remove other rows with set strings of interest.
